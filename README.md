# Color-background-exercise
Exercise 1.1.7

This time we try to replicate a background and color exercise, with 3 differents boxes:
-The first has just a background color.
-Second one it is covered with a background image.
-Last one contains the image but we can also see the same background color of the first.

Check image named "result" on my folder and check my HTML and CSS to see what was my decision. 

Thanks!
